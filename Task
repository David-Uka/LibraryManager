Task 1: Working with Arrays of Books*  
Goal: Get better at using arrays, loops, and functions in JavaScript.  
Problem:  
You’re going to create a function called processBookData(books) that works with a list of books. Each book is an object with details like title, author, year, and genre. Your function should do the following:  
1. Take the list of books as input.  
2. Return an object with three things:  
   - A list of books that were published after the year 2000.  
   - A list of all the authors’ names, sorted in alphabetical order.  
   - A count of how many books there are in each genre (e.g., { "Sci-Fi": 3, "Mystery": 2 }).  

---

### What You’ll Learn  
- How to use array methods like filter, map, and reduce to work with data.  
- How to sort lists and remove duplicates.  
- How to handle errors, like what to do if the input is empty or not in the right format.  

---

### Steps to Get Started  
1. Understand the Input:  
   The input is an array of book objects. Each book looks something like this:  
   js
   {
     title: "The Great Gatsby",
     author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
     year: 1925,
     genre: "Classic"
   }
   

2. Filter Books Published After 2000:  
   Use the filter method to create a new array of books where the year is greater than 2000.  

3. Sort Authors Alphabetically:  
   Extract all the authors’ names, remove duplicates (if any), and sort them in alphabetical order.  

4. Count Books by Genre:  
   Use a loop or the reduce method to count how many books belong to each genre.  

5. Handle Edge Cases:  
   Think about what happens if the input is empty or not in the correct format. How will your function handle that?  

---

### Things to Think About  
- Duplicate Authors: What if the same author wrote multiple books? How will you make sure their name only appears once in the sorted list?  
- Grouping by Genre: How can you efficiently count the number of books in each genre?  
- Error Handling: What should your function do if the input is empty or not an array?  

---

### Example Input and Output  
Input:  
js
const books = [
  { title: "Book A", author: "Author X", year: 1999, genre: "Sci-Fi" },
  { title: "Book B", author: "Author Y", year: 2005, genre: "Mystery" },
  { title: "Book C", author: "Author X", year: 2010, genre: "Sci-Fi" },
  { title: "Book D", author: "Author Z", year: 2015, genre: "Mystery" }
];


Output:  
js
{
  booksAfter2000: [
    { title: "Book B", author: "Author Y", year: 2005, genre: "Mystery" },
    { title: "Book C", author: "Author X", year: 2010, genre: "Sci-Fi" },
    { title: "Book D", author: "Author Z", year: 2015, genre: "Mystery" }
  ],
  sortedAuthors: ["Author X", "Author Y", "Author Z"],
  genreCount: { "Sci-Fi": 2, "Mystery": 2 }
}


---

### Tips for Success  
- Break the problem into smaller parts. For example, first focus on filtering the books, then move on to sorting the authors, and finally count the genres.  
- Use console.log() to check your work at each step.  
- If you get stuck, look up JavaScript array methods like filter, map, and reduce to see how they work.  

---

### Bonus Challenge  
- Add a feature to your function that calculates the average year of publication for all the books.  
- Modify the function to handle case-insensitive sorting of authors’ names (e.g., "author x" and "Author X" should be treated as the same).  

This task will help you practice working with arrays, objects, and functions while solving a real-world problem. Take your time, and don’t be afraid to experiment!
*Task 3: Navigating Nested Categories in Your Library*  
*Goal:* Learn to work with folders-within-folders structures using your Library class.  
*Problem:*  
Your library now needs to organize books into *nested categories*, like:  
- A "Sci-Fi" category might have subcategories like "Dystopian" or "Space Opera".  
- Each category can hold books and more subcategories.  

Add a method getAllBookPaths() to your Library class that:  
1. *Recursively explores* these nested categories.  
2. Returns an array of all book paths in the format "Category/Subcategory/.../Book Title".  

---

### *Example Structure*  
js  
// Inside your Library class:  
{  
  name: "Fiction",  
  books: [{ title: "The Hobbit" }],  
  subcategories: [  
    {  
      name: "Sci-Fi",  
      books: [{ title: "Dune" }],  
      subcategories: [  
        {  
          name: "Dystopian",  
          books: [{ title: "1984" }],  
          subcategories: []  
        }  
      ]  
    }  
  ]  
}  

// getAllBookPaths() should return:  
// ["Fiction/The Hobbit", "Fiction/Sci-Fi/Dune", "Fiction/Sci-Fi/Dystopian/1984"]

### *Questions to Guide You*  
1. *Breaking Down the Problem:*  
   - How do you start at the top-level category (e.g., "Fiction") and move "deeper" into subcategories step by step?  
   - What’s the *repeating pattern* you can use for each category (check books → check subcategories → repeat)?  

2. *Building Paths:*  
   - If you’re in the "Sci-Fi/Dystopian" category, how do you keep track of the full path ("Fiction/Sci-Fi/Dystopian") as you go deeper?  

3. *Connecting to Task 2:*  
   - How will you adjust your existing Library class to store this nested structure instead of a flat list?  
   - Does addBook() need to change to let users specify a category path (e.g., "Fiction/Sci-Fi")?  

4. *Edge Cases:*  
   - What if a category has *both books and subcategories*?  
   - How do you avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop if a subcategory accidentally references itself?  

---

### *Hints*  
- Think of nested categories like *folders on your computer*:  
  - Open a folder → see files (books) and more folders (subcategories).  
  - For every new folder you open, repeat the same steps.  
- Use *string concatenation* to build paths (e.g., currentPath + "/" + categoryName).  
- Start small! Test with a single category first, then add nesting.  

---

This builds on your Library class by introducing *hierarchical organization* and forces you to solve problems like "how do I repeat an action for every layer of nesting?"—a key skill for working with real-world data!
